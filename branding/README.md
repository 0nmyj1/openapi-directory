If you using our catalog to create some product we would appreciate if you spread a word about this project.
It's not mandatory, but definitely help us to grow bigger and entire API ecosystem will benefit from it.

Pages which show some info from our catalog could have one of the following links:
 - **Powered by \<LOGO\>**
 - **API specs supplied by \<LOGO\>**

All link should be pointing to http://APIs.guru, at the moment it's **temporary** redirected to GitHub repo.

You should use only official logos:

| [Logo]| [Horizontal logo]| [Vertical logo]|
|-------|------------------|----------------|
|![Logo]|![Horizontal logo]|![Vertical logo]|

Correct way to write our name is **APIs.guru** with exact this combination of uppercase and lowercase letters.
We recommended to use [Sansation](http://www.dafont.com/sansation.font) font for this purpose or use logo with name included.

Please add **"How can I request/add/fix an API?"** section into customer documentation or FAQ.
<BR>**TBD**: Create sample text.
