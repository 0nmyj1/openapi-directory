Repository for API models in Swagger 2.0 format

Our goal is to create machine-readable Wikipedia for REST APIs, with following principals:
- Open source.
- Community driven project
- Only publicly available APIs(free or paid).
- Anyone can add/changes API, not only API owners.
- All data could be accessed through REST API(free, but API key required).

**If you have Swagger files for any public API, please feel free to make pull request.**

API spec acceptance criteria
--------------------------
* Public - anyone can access it as long as he follow some clearly defined steps(email owner, pay money, etc.)
* Persistant - API is made with long live goal, and not for partucular event(conference, hackaton, etc.)
* Useful - API could provide usefull functionality not only for it owner.
