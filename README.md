Repository for API models in Swagger 2.0 format

Our goal is to create machine-readable Wikipedia for REST APIs, with following principals:
- Open source, community driven project
- Only publicly available APIs(free or paid).
- Anyone can add/changes API, not only API owners.
- All data could be accessed through [REST API](API.md).

If you want refence this project, and you need icon or even banner check our [branding guide](branding/README.md)

[You can also support project using BountySource](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/apis_guru)<br>
Also we provide services and consultancy around Swagger spec and REST API in general.
