# api-models
Repository for API models in Swagger 2.0 format

Our goal is to create machine-readable Wikipedia for REST APIs, with following principals:
- Open source.
- Community driven project
- Only publicly available APIs(free or paid).
- Anyone can add/changes API, not only API owners.
- All data could be accessed through REST API(free, but API key required).
